## 1. Introduction

    Overview
    
The Health and Wellbeing Monitor is basically some sensors in a garment that relays the data to an Android mobile telephone to be displayed graphically for the user to peruse. The data will be assessed by the Mobile application and notifications will be sent to the user if predefined limits are reached. For example if the user is interested in fitness and increasing muscle mass, our system will notify them of the optimal conditions. Taking into account all the data taken from the sensors and the phone.

## 2. System Architecture

This section describes the high-level overview of the system architecture showing the distribution functions across (potential) system modules. Architectural components that are reused or 3rd party should be highlighted. Unlike the architecture in the Functional Specification - this description must reflect the design components of the system as it is demonstrated.




3. High-Level Design

This section should set out the high-level design of the system. It should include system models showing the relationship between system components and the systems and its environment. These might be object-models, DFD, etc. Unlike the design in the Functional Specification - this description must reflect the design of the system as it is demonstrated.

4. Problems and Resolution

This section should include a description of any major problems encountered during the design and implementation of the system and the actions that were taken to resolve them.

5. Installation Guide

This is a 1 to 2 page section which contains a step by step software installation guide. It should include a detailed description of the steps necessary to install the software, a list of all required software, components, versions, hardware, etc.
