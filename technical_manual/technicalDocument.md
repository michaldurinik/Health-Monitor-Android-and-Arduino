## 1. Introduction

##### 1.1 Overview
    
The Health and Wellbeing Monitor portrays to its user information collected from sensors in a garment. The data is analysed by a tiny computer in the jacket and passed on an Android mobile telephone. At which point the data will be assessed and displayed numerically for the user to observe.

## 2. System Architecture

A wearable, but not waterproof microprocessing unit called a Flora, developed by AdaFruit. Has attached to it a heart rate sensor, a multitude of temperature sensors and a Bluetooth device for transmitting the data from the different sensors.

The User will wear a jacket or a jumper, with:
 - Flora microprocessor
 - Bluefruit LE Bluetooth
 - 3 LM35, 1 DS18B20 Temperature sensors
 - Heart Rate light sensor
 - Battery holder with connector and switch

sewn into the chosen garment.

Phones used for the testing of the application were:

- HTC one M8api 23 marshmallow
- HTC Desire 825 api 23 marshmallow

Emulators used in the testing of the application were:

- Nexus 5

The phone application provided for interaction with the jacket consists of three main activities:

- Greeting screen
- Personal settings screen
- Sensor monitor screen

The greetings screen is an activity containing a list with the other two events as the options
The personal settings screen is an activity providing a list of editable and read-only choices allowing to user to enter their personal information needed for the smooth running of the product.
From the entries into the height and weight categories, the body mass index is calculated and displayed
The Sensor monitor screen is where the magic happens, once selected and the screen is displayed a background service starts and connects to the jackets Bluetooth advertisement.
The monitor screen is then updated when the jackets sensors change.

## 4. Problems and Resolution

##### 4.1 Setting-up Arduino IDE on Linux
Setting up permissions to communicate with the Flora board.

Adding user to these groups: adm, uucp, lock, tty
> gpasswd -a $USER uucp


Making lock owner of lock group
> chown root:lock /run/lock

Finally give permission to write in /run/lock to its owner 
> chmod g+w /run/lock

Disabling this service before starting Arduino IDE
> sudo systemctl stop ModemManager.service

##### 4.2 At commands and GATT services
Lots of documentation reading was necessary to understand how to send commands to Bluetooth module, such as setting up heart rate monitor service advertisement
> AT+GATTADDSERVICE=UUID=0x180D

##### 4.3 Flora memory capacity
We had to swap temperature sensor LM35 to DS18B20 temperature module due to measurement fluctuations of up to 15 Â°C. New libraries had to be imported and our compiled Flora binary file exceeded 29KB. 
Disabling or reducing the number of features was necessary to reduce size. Some of them were using up to 3% of entire system memory
* printout to serial port for debugging reduced
* display text animations and logo disabled
* display draw calls reduced, the way of displaying information was restructured and optimised heavily
* changing temperature variable Type from float to integer decreased memory by 3%, but also its precision. This change was reverted as more memory was freed elsewhere and we kept two decimal precision.
* BLE debugging messages and feedback reduced

##### 4.4 Getting an app to connect to BLE peripheral
This was proven to be the most challenging task of the project. To get a better understanding of the topic, we read official Google documentation profoundly. 

However, some of the information was outdated and methods used in examples deprecated. 
We read and tried to understand every guide we could find online on the topic.
Countless code snippets were tested.

##### 4.5 Reading GATT sensor data by an app
Even though the connection was established and GATT services visible and readable, GATT connection services flag was set as false and data weren't passed on to write callback.

By setting it as true it allowed information to be passed to read call back.

We had to use short Type for data instead of an integer as it was 2-byte value to extract heart rate measurements.


## 5. Installation Guide

The Health and Wellbeing application has been designed for Android release version Android 6.0 Marshmallow. It should work in some lower versions back to Android 4.3 JellyBean. In Android 4.3 and later, the Android Bluetooth stack provided the ability to implement Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

To install the Health and Wellbeing Android phone APK
There are different ways to install an android app on your phone:
- [ ] The Easiest way is to download the application from the Android Market or the website directly to the SD card mounted in your phone, then click on the APK file to install it.
